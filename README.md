![simple gLV equation](equations/simple_gLV.png)

Where:
- i = species i in group of species
- Ni = species i abundance
- Left side of equation = change of species i abundance per unit of time
- ri = intrinsic growth rate of species i
- Ai<-j = effect of species j on species i
- Bi<-jk = effect of species j and k on species i
